This is just a place for me to keep bash scripts that I've hacked together over the years for administering Unix systems. Some of the stuff in here are works in progress.

The `syncmon` directory is currently a collection of scripts for automatically generating basic documentation info in the markdown format for systems using common Unix tools. At the moment it is intended to be sent off to a server, but this will later be replaced using Syncthing to reduce having a single point of failure.
